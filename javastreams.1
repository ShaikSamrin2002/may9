we cannot access the class directly . we have to create a object to access the class
import java.io.*;
io indicates input stream and output stream
* indicated it includes all files

OOPS:
Object Oriented programming  
with this we know real world problem
CLASS IS BLUEPRINT TEMPLATE OF THE OBJECT 
OBJECT IS REAL WORLD ENTITY WHICH HAS SOME PROPERTIES AND FUNCTIONALITIES
let suppose there are 10 students,every student has same properties like name,age
we can create main class to store data of every student with object...(s2 for student 2)
inside main class ,variables are called instance variables like name,age etc.,


** we are able to access the class within the package
** if we want to access any class outside the package so to do that we have to import that package

EXAMPLE CODE:





CONSTRUCTOR : 1.default constructor (same class) --> does not arguments
              2.parameterized constructor --> has parameters or arguments

CODE:
package object_and_class;

public class student {
	String name;
	int rollno;

		student() {
			System.out.println("This is a default constructor");;
		}
	}
O/P: //CLASS IS CREATED 

package object_and_class;

public class Studentuse {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		student s1=new student();
		s1.name="Samrin";
		s1.rollno=2434;
		
		student s2=new student();
		s2.name="rehan";
		s2.rollno=6565;
		
		System.out.println(s1.name);
		System.out.println(s1.rollno);
		System.out.println(s2.name);
		System.out.println(s2.rollno);
	}
}

O/P:This is a default constructor
This is a default constructor
Samrin
2434
rehan
6565


TO ACCESS DIRECTLY WITHOUT USING S1.NAME by using parametarized constructor...
INSTEAD WE HAVE TO WRITE PARAMETER LIKE 
student(String s,int rn) {
    name=s;
    rollno;
    }
    
  public void print() {
  System.out.println(name+" "+rollno);
  }
  
  CODE:
 package object_and_class;

public class Studentuse {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		student s1=new student("Vamsi",100);
		s1.print();
		}
}

O/P:Vamsi 100



PRIVATE:
BY CREATING METHODS IN CLASS WE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS PRIVATE DATA MEMBERS.
    
CODE:
student(String s,int rn) {
    name=s;
    private rollno;
    }
  // method 
  public void setRollNumber(int n) {
     if(rn<=0)
     {
      syso("please enter valid age");
      }
      else {
      
  

FINAL KEYWORD:
